v0.5.6
- Improved power calibration guess values
- PIPO support imporvements, test_crop for faster fitting, resample option
	added
	
v0.5.5
- Improved PIPONATOR support, option to pad data to 128, clear (0,0) pixel
    artifact
- PIPO fitting overhaul, added AG C6 PIPO fitting formula, added automatic fit
    accelerator generation and fast guess value estimation via fit accelerator,
    added a FitStruct class for better fit data handling
- PIPO data now reported with angle axes instead of state IDs
- NSMP fitting performance improvements
- Major axis changed to X in NSMP MS contraction. This seems to be needed to
    match lcmicro output to PIPONATOR
- Added a new nonlinear polarimetry validation test
- Added Mueller matrices for polarization rotator, Fresnel transmission and
    reflection
- A typo that was letting all tensor tests to succeed
- Removed hardcoded PIPO_6x6 state set assumption in verification

v0.5.4
- Swapped PSG/PSA fixed in PIPONATOR TIFF exporting
